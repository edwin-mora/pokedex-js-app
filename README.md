# pokedex-js-app

Description
This project is one of my first projects in the full-stack developer course. It is a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

The app displays a searchable list of pokemon names. When the user clicks on the name of a pokemon, a modal appears displaying further details on the pokemon (image, height, weight, and types) fetched from an external API.

The app uses the following API to load information on pokemon: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

The app used React-Bootstrap to style it out.
